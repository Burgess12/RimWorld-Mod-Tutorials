if you are not familiar with C#, .NET or any java-like language, you should probably learn the basics before you start modding.
* [C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

Before you start modding, you should install the following tools:
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) (Required to compile C# code)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Useful for version control and backing up your mod)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Good for editing XML code)
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (The Go to free IDE for C# code)
* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (free for students. Personally I prefer this over Visual Studio)
* [ilSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) (Good for decompiling Rimworld's DLLs)
* [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) (Slow. but a good alternative to ilSpy)
* [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) (While a great tool, it struggles with Rimworld's code. Still good for helping with the basics and writing comments)
